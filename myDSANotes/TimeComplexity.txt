Time Complexity and Big O:

Big O is having 2 parts of it: Mathematical definition and Industrial Definition
Industry Def Big O can also be called as Order of 

Big O
Big Theta
Big Omega

O(n) can automatically be O(n^2) as well
and that also can automatically be O(n^3)
Keep going on higher order - this is the Mathematical definition

Coming to the Industrial definition part, the lesser the better so we consider only the major parts
Industry defintion is minimum of these(summarize)


whenever I use Mathematical definition I use the term: Big O
whenever I use Industrial definition I use the term: Order O

Big O and Order Of can be used interchangeably but we should know the complete story
