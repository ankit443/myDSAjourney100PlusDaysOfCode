 + can be used to appended strings together to form 

 Strings can be stored in any manner in the memory

 are mutable: meaning the characters in the char array can be changed
 the characters in the so assigned string cannot be changed thats why they are immutable 
 the charAt() method can be used to access characters at a particular index in a string 
 Elements in character array
