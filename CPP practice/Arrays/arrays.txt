Arrays in CPP

int a; declaration;
int dost[10]; 

lets say we have 5 size ka Arrays

our first node has address 100, then 108 then 112

so variable name such as int v[5] so the v will showup with the first location

indexing 
 
 lets say we have 0 1 2 3 indexes
 so our first location is 0 and we have 2 as the element there

 so vo[0] will have a value of 2

 cout<<v[0];
 so output will be 2 since first element is 2

 v[1] so 
 the apporach would be like: v has first starting address of 1, so next address is 104
 so 100 + 1*4 we will have 104 so cout<<v[1] will give output 6 since 6 is second element

 lets say we have v[3] so we want to find the output of the 4th index so  the apporach would be like
 lets say our starting first address is on 100

 so 100 + 3*4 equals 112 (why multiply by 4? because of 4 bytes per element)

 so the element on 112 address is 8


 so the basic knowledge what one must have is
 the starting location of an array starts from 0 index then it keeps increasing



 * what is declaration
 * how to access
 * 5th location means dost[4] because index count starts from 0 

 so from 0 to (n-1) where n equals the size of array

 *initialisation:

 int a =5; 

 example: int number[3] = {5, 7, 11} syntax of array example

 array's name is number of size 3


 example" int array[10000];

 if we dont mention the elements, anything random could have been stored


 h/w: initialize entire array with any element value: how to do it?
