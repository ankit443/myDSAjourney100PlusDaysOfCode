time complexity: it is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run 
as a function of length of the input

for making better programs
comparison of algorithms

big O notations: for upper bound 
theta - for average case complexity 
omega - lower bound

constant time: O(1)
example: for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
    cout<<"hello";

}



linear time: O(n)
example:for(int i=0; i<N; i++){
    cout<<endl;
}


logarithmic time: O(logn)
example: Binary Search


quadratic time: O(n^2)
example: nested for loops


cubic time: O(n^3)
example: triple for loops


examples to figure out TC:
2n^2 + 3 n : ignore the lower degrees, so TC is bigO(n^2)

4n^4 + 3n^3: TC: O(n^4)

N^2 + LogN = 



Space Complexity: how much memory
