binarySearch:

for loop
if arr[i] == key, return this, return that, etc, else return this. TC of O(n)

in linear search case, n size ke case mein, worst case mein N comparison

binarySearch only works on monotonic functions
monotonic functions meaning: either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing
condition: element should be in monotonic functions
